     Hi there! My name is Frank Corridori. I’m a full-time professor here at the University of Missouri working in the Strategic Communication department of the J-School. My background is in graphic design, and art direction for advertising. I also work with students as the Creative Director of MOJO Ad®, the student-staffed advertising agency on campus. When I first started my career as a designer, I did some HTML coding and web design / development, and a fair amount of Flash website development, and actionscripting (RIP Flash).  I’m mostly looking to refamiliarize myself with web design / coding and modern best practices. I’m incredibly rusty with HTML, as I haven’t had to use that muscle in a long time, and thought it would be worthwhile revisiting and redeveloping some old skillsets. Some of my first projects will likely be marketing materials that I use for myself, and my interests. In the little free time that I have, I enjoy cycling, playing guitar, cooking, photography, and painting. I also really like cars and motorcycles, and enjoy taking mine out for leisurely drives with no particular destination in mind.
